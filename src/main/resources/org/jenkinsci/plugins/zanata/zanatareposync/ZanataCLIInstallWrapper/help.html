  Jenkins admin can configure Zanata CLI installation at Global tools page.
  Here you can choose which Zanata CLI to install (if not already installed) on the build machine (master or slave).
  The installation home will be exported as a variable for you to use in build step using "Execute shell".
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> You will not need to configure a build step using Zanata Sync if you invoke Zanata CLI directly in a shell build step.
