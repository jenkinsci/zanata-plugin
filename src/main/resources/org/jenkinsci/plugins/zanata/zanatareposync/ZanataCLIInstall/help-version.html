  The Zanata CLI version that corresponds to the installed tool. This will then be used as the tool name.
  Since tool name will become part of environment variable, all '.', '-' will be converted to '_'.
  e.g. input "4.0.0" will make the installation with "zanata_cli_4_0_0" as tool name.
  All Zanata CLI installations will appear in your job configuration to choose for installing on the jenkins node.
  The installed CLI will not affect the build-in Zanata Sync build step which uses a pre-bundled java library (a sub module from a fixed version of Zanata CLI)
